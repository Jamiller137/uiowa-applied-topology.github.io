  I am an RTG Postdoctoral Fellow in Mathematics at The University of Iowa.
  I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2022 from NC State under the mentorship
  of Tye Lidman. My research interests include low-dimensional topology, knot
  theory, Floer homological theories, and topological data analysis and
  visualization. I am also interested in incorporating active-learning and
  generative AI in my classes.
