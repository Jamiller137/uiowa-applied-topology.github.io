fullbio: |-
  I specialize in computational knot theory, specifically tabulation of knot-like objects. My recent 
  research focuses on understanding and classifying tangles, which contributes to the broader 
  field of knot theory.

  In addition to my academic pursuits, I have substantial industry experience in
  software engineering and project management. This experience has equipped me
  with a practical understanding of technology and its applications, which
  complements my theoretical research.

  Beyond my mathematical research, I am passionate about education, particularly
  in training undergraduate researchers.
