fullbio: |-
  I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at the University of Iowa, specializing in
  knot theory and tangle tabulation. My research focuses on understanding and
  classifying tangles, which contributes to the broader field of knot theory.

  In addition to my academic pursuits, I have substantial industry experience in
  software engineering and project management. This experience has equipped me
  with a practical understanding of technology and its applications, which
  complements my theoretical research.

  Beyond my mathematical research, I am passionate about education, particularly
  in training undergraduate researchers.
