Our arborescent tangle tabulation project presents a comprehensive study on the
tabulation of arborescent
tangles{{< cite "bonahonNewGeometricSplittings2016" >}}. Arborescent tangles are
constructed by taking a collection of twisted bands described by a weighted tree
and connecting them with successive plumbing. The arborescent tangles are shown
to be equivalent to Conway's algebraic
tangles{{< cite "conwayEnumerationKnotsLinks1970" >}}.

Key results include the development of a unique representative for arborescent
tangles, an encoding strategy for computational purposes, and an algorithm for
generating minimal arborescent tangles. The study also introduces the concept of
Right Leaning Identity Canonical Abbreviated Weighted Planar Tangle Trees
(RLITT), proving their existence, uniqueness, and providing an efficient
generation algorithm.

This work contributes to the field by offering a robust framework for the
enumeration and classification of arborescent tangles, supported by both
theoretical insights and practical computational tools.
