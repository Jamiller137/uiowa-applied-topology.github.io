# About us

The Applied Topology Group at The University of Iowa, led by Dr. Isabel Darcy,
is a diverse team of faculty, postdocs, and graduate students dedicated to
advancing the field of topology through innovative research and collaborative
learning. Our interests encompass applied and computational knot theory,
mathematical biology, topological data visualization, topological data
analysis, and the Mapper algorithm.

We pride ourselves on fostering a supportive and inclusive environment where
experienced members guide and mentor newer members, promoting both personal and
professional growth. This vertical integration ensures that knowledge and
skills are passed down effectively, creating a strong sense of community and
collaboration within the group.

Our approach to learning is hands-on and dynamic. We regularly host seminars
and workshops to explore new techniques and methodologies, allowing us to stay
at the forefront of our field. These events not only enhance our technical
expertise but also strengthen our teamwork and problem-solving abilities.

Join us in exploring the fascinating world of topology and its real-world
applications. Whether you're a seasoned researcher or just starting your
journey in topology, the Applied Topology Group at The University of Iowa
offers a welcoming and stimulating environment to grow and succeed.
