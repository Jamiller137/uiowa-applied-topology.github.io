## Schedule

All days start with coffee at 8:30am and talks at 9am. Most days end at 5:30pm.
We will end the official part of the workshop at 12:30pm on Friday, but
participants are encouraged to stay Friday afternoon to work on software
development and/or collaborate on analyzing data sets after lunch on Friday.

Lunch will be on your own. There are many restaurants within walking distance.
