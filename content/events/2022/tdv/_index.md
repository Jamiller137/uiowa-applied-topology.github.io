## Date: May 16 - 20, 2022

### Organizers

[Isabel Darcy, University of Iowa](https://homepage.math.uiowa.edu/%7Eidarcy/)
and [Bei Wang, University of Utah](https://www.sci.utah.edu/~beiwang/)

Funded by NSF DMS RTG 2038103: [PI Keiko Kawamuro](https://kawamuro.weebly.com/)

The workshop format is expected to be in person; however, many talks will be
available online. Thus we expect to have both in person and online participants.
Not all activities will be available to online participants.

Some datasets are too small for standard statistical/data analysis to accurately
characterize the data. Others are extremely large and data size reduction
methods may be needed. One solution is to use topological data analysis to
simplify and/or visualize data. This workshop will include both tutorials and
research talks on topological techniques for visualizing data.
